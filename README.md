# 📊 Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers to help businesses tailor marketing strategies, product recommendations, and improve customer engagement.

# 🔍 Business Requirement
Understanding customer groups is crucial for any business aiming to personalize services and improve satisfaction. Instead of manually categorizing, this project uses machine learning clustering algorithms to automate the segmentation process.

# 📁 Dataset
The dataset used contains key customer metrics such as:

Annual Income

Spending Score

Age

Gender

# 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
✅ K-Means Clustering:
Used Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (k)

Applied KMeans(n_clusters=k) to cluster customers

Visualized the cluster separation using scatter plots

✅ DBSCAN:
Explored Density-Based Spatial Clustering to capture non-linear cluster shapes

Suitable for discovering outliers and arbitrary-shaped clusters

# 📊 Evaluation & Visualization
Visualized clusters using:

2D scatter plots

Pairplots

Dendrograms

Evaluated clustering cohesion and separation

Explained which algorithm worked best based on interpretability and shape of clusters

# 🛠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

# 🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates customer segmentation using various clustering algorithms. It helps businesses:

Understand customer behavior

Target marketing campaigns more effectively

Improve customer retention

Among the methods, K-Means provided clear and intuitive clusters, while DBSCAN was explored for its robustness to noise and outliers.
